# ARGUS Backstory

This directory is where ARGUS keeps its long memory.

The root `README.md` combines practical startup instructions with architectural doctrine. This folder provides the long-form narrative context behind those technical choices.

Read [The ARGUS Story](story.md), which now includes:

- [Mythological Model](story.md#mythological-model)
- [Star Trek Connection](story.md#star-trek-connection)
- [Power User Workflows](story.md#power-user-workflows)
- [Credits and Acknowledgments](story.md#credits-and-acknowledgments)

After this narrative pass, continue into `docs/onboarding.adoc`, `docs/framework.adoc`, `docs/vcs.adoc`, `docs/calypso.adoc`, and `docs/oracle.adoc` for implementation detail.
