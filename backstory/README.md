# ARGUS Backstory

This directory is the narrative wing of ARGUS. The root `README.md` is intentionally operational and concise, but this folder preserves the longer context that explains why the system is shaped the way it is and why certain architectural choices are non-negotiable.

The best entry point is `story.md`, which tells the full arc from problem framing through interface philosophy and data-state architecture. From there, each companion chapter deepens one dimension of the same worldview.

`mythology.md` describes how ATLAS, ARGUS, and CALYPSO are more than names: they are role contracts that keep language, architecture, and user expectations aligned. `trek.md` traces the LCARS and CALYPSO/Zora lineage and shows how those references translate into concrete design decisions rather than surface aesthetics. `powertoys.md` follows the operator path, documenting how advanced users script, replay, and test flows without forfeiting determinism. `credits.md` records the people and prior work that materially informed the project.

Taken together, these files are not marketing copy. They are maintenance documents for meaning. As the codebase evolves, the backstory keeps the product voice and interaction ethic coherent across UI, CLI, and embedded CALYPSO contexts.

For technical depth after the narrative pass, continue into `docs/onboarding.adoc`, `docs/framework.adoc`, `docs/vcs.adoc`, `docs/calypso.adoc`, and `docs/oracle.adoc`.
