# Mythological Metaphor

ARGUS uses three linked mythological figures as a system metaphor:

- **ATLAS**: the infrastructure that bears distributed compute, storage, and governance weight.
- **ARGUS**: the "hundred eyes" interface that provides visibility into federated workflows.
- **CALYPSO**: the intent layer that conceals operational complexity and guides users through it.

In project terms:

- ATLAS is the platform substrate.
- ARGUS is the operational console.
- CALYPSO is the intent engine that maps natural language to deterministic actions.

This framing helps keep product language consistent across UI, CLI, and architecture docs.
