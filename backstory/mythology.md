# Mythological Metaphor

ARGUS borrows three mythic names because they describe the architecture better than abstract product language ever could. ATLAS is the bearer: it carries infrastructure weight across compute, storage, security boundaries, and governance domains. The name is less decoration than contract; when we say ATLAS, we mean the substrate that can carry distributed load without collapsing under coordination overhead.

ARGUS is the watcher. In Greek myth, Argus Panoptes is the many-eyed guardian; in this project, ARGUS is the operational console that keeps many moving parts visible at once. Its role is not to do every transformation itself but to maintain situational awareness across workflows, artifacts, and execution states so the user can act with confidence.

CALYPSO completes the triad as the intent mediator. In practice, CALYPSO is the layer that lets a human speak in goals while the system translates those goals into deterministic actions. That translation does not remove rigor; it moves rigor into a consistent command surface that can be audited, replayed, and tested.

Taken together, the naming system is a design discipline. ATLAS carries, ARGUS sees, and CALYPSO guides. The metaphor keeps product language stable across UI, CLI, and architecture docs, and that consistency reduces ambiguity when the system grows.
