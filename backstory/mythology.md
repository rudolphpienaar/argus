# Mythological Metaphor

The naming system in ARGUS is not ornamental branding. It is a semantic scaffold that keeps architecture, interface language, and user expectation in sync. In distributed systems work, vocabulary drift is expensive: people start using the same word for different responsibilities, and then design discussions become ambiguous. The mythology triad is a deliberate guard against that drift.

ATLAS is the bearer role. It names the substrate that carries burden across institutions, storage boundaries, model lifecycles, and governance constraints. When engineers refer to ATLAS, the expectation is infrastructure resilience and policy-aware coordination, not user-facing comfort. This distinction matters because platform promises and console promises must be evaluated differently.

ARGUS is the seeing role. In myth, Argus Panoptes is the all-seeing guardian; in product terms, ARGUS is the console that keeps many states visible without collapsing into visual noise. Visibility here is not equivalent to verbosity. The goal is to make consequential state transitions obvious: what was searched, what was gathered, what was transformed, what artifacts were produced, and what remains pending.

CALYPSO is the mediating role. In practice, CALYPSO translates intent phrased in human terms into deterministic actions that mutate state. That translation layer is strongest when it is humble about execution truth. CALYPSO can guide, suggest, and accelerate, but progress is still proven by materialized artifacts and explicit command outcomes.

The triad also provides a clean mapping to implementation boundaries. ATLAS maps to distributed execution substrate and governance context. ARGUS maps to workflow surface, state visibility, and operator tooling. CALYPSO maps to routing, conversational interpretation, and script orchestration. When these boundaries remain explicit, the system scales without semantic confusion.

There is also a tone contract embedded in the naming. ATLAS should feel robust. ARGUS should feel aware. CALYPSO should feel precise and steady under uncertainty. This tone is not merely UX polish; it affects trust. In high-stakes domains like medical imaging and federated learning, users read tone as a proxy for system maturity.

Finally, the mythology keeps documentation coherent. A chapter in architecture docs, a command in CLI, and a line in CALYPSO dialogue should all describe the same role model. When the metaphors are stable, language becomes composable, and composable language is one of the strongest predictors of maintainable software systems.
