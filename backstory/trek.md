# Star Trek Connection

ARGUS intentionally references Star Trek in two ways:

## 1) LCARS Visual Language

The interface is based on **LCARS** (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System), originally designed by Michael Okuda for *Star Trek: The Next Generation*.

In ARGUS, LCARS is treated as an operational UI grammar, not just aesthetics:

- dense, status-forward information surfaces
- command-and-telemetry coexistence
- stage-driven workflow cues

## 2) Calypso/Zora Throughline

The name **CALYPSO** references the *Short Treks* episode "Calypso" and Zora from *Star Trek: Discovery*.

The mapping in ARGUS is deliberate:

- Zora as patient guide through uncertainty
- CALYPSO as deterministic intent mediator over complex infrastructure
- LCARS as shared visual/interaction lineage

This Trek throughline reinforces the product intent: a high-context intelligence console that helps experts navigate complex distributed systems.
