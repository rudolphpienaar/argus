# Credits and Acknowledgments

ARGUS is led and architected by Rudolph Pienaar. The work is also grounded in design and engineering traditions that predate this repository and deserve explicit credit.

The visual language is deeply indebted to Michael Okuda's LCARS design for Star Trek: The Next Generation. His system established the idea that futuristic interfaces can still feel operationally precise, and that influence remains central to ARGUS.

Practical LCARS implementation patterns in this codebase were further informed by Jim Robertus and TheLCARS.com, whose reference material helped translate iconic visual grammar into web-native structure.

Development velocity and iteration breadth were amplified through AI-assisted collaboration using Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini. Those tools contributed to throughput, but the project's direction and architectural intent remain human-defined and review-driven.
