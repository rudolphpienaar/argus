# Credits and Acknowledgments

ARGUS is architected and led by Rudolph Pienaar.

The project also stands on prior work that deserves explicit credit. Its visual and interaction language is deeply influenced by Michael Okuda's LCARS design for *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, not only as an aesthetic reference but as a model for information-dense operational interfaces.

Web-facing LCARS implementation in this repository was further informed by Jim Robertus and TheLCARS.com, whose reference work helped translate iconic design motifs into practical browser patterns.

Development velocity was significantly improved through AI-assisted collaboration with Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini. Those tools expanded iteration bandwidth, but architecture, acceptance standards, and product direction remained human-owned.

This section exists because provenance matters. Explicit lineage makes design choices easier to evaluate and easier to maintain.
