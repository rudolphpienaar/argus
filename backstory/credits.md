- **Architect & Lead:** Rudolph Pienaar
- **Original Design:** The visual language is based on **LCARS** (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System), designed by **Michael Okuda** for *Star Trek: The Next Generation*. His work from the 1980s remains a major reference point for functional futuristic interface design.
- **LCARS Reference Implementation:** The CSS architecture and visual fidelity of this project are heavily informed by **Jim Robertus** and [TheLCARS.com](https://www.thelcars.com).
- **AI Collaboration:** Development was accelerated using an agentic workflow with Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini.
