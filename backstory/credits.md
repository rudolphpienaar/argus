# Credits and Acknowledgments

ARGUS is architected and directed by Rudolph Pienaar, but the project is intentionally transparent about the influences and collaborators that shaped its language and execution style.

The visual and interaction DNA owes a significant debt to Michael Okuda's LCARS work for Star Trek: The Next Generation. That contribution is foundational not only for look-and-feel but for a deeper lesson: interfaces can be expressive without sacrificing operational clarity.

Practical web adaptation of LCARS idioms in this repository was also informed by Jim Robertus and TheLCARS.com. Their reference work helped bridge the gap between iconic television design and maintainable browser implementation patterns.

The modern development loop for ARGUS has been accelerated through AI-assisted collaboration, including Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini. These tools improved iteration speed, comparison of alternatives, and breadth of exploration. At the same time, architectural accountability, design direction, and acceptance standards remain human-owned.

Acknowledgment in ARGUS is treated as engineering hygiene. Systems grow better when provenance is explicit, and design choices are easier to evaluate when their lineage is documented instead of implied.
