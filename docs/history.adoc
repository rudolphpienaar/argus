== Abstract

The ARGUS (ATLAS Resource Guided User System) project represents a relentless, single-developer engineering investigation into the "Truth Gap" of AI-mediated scientific research. Since its inception on January 23, 2026, the system has evolved through multiple architectural phases, transitioning from a monolithic UI-centric prototype into a high-integrity system kernel grounded in Merkle-proven materialization. This document provides an exhaustive, forensic narrative of that evolution, providing a dedicated technical analysis for every significant version bump in the project's history.

Each section details the specific technical pressures—such as monolithic drift, instructional decay, and the irreducible hallucination of agency—that necessitated the continuous refactoring of the system's core during this high-velocity solo sprint. The architectural decisions documented here are not the result of user studies, but the expression of over two decades of practitioner expertise in scientific computing systems. By documenting the "Historical Drama" of every milestone, this specification provides the necessary context for understanding why the v10.0 architecture is the only mathematically viable solution for high-stakes federated research.

== Phase I: Genesis and the Codification of "SeaGaP" (v1.0 - v1.4)
_Period: January 23 – January 25, 2026_

=== Status Quo: The Initial Prototype
The project commenced on January 23, 2026, with the goal of proving that a unified interface could manage the complexities of federated data discovery for the ATLAS platform. At this stage, the codebase was a monolithic "Developer Vertical" where the UI was the primary driver of the logic. The system could demonstrate interaction, but it lacked the structural constraints required to ensure scientific correctness. The immediate challenge was organizing diverse research tasks into a coherent, repeatable sequence.

=== Version 1.0: The SeaGaP Baseline
Released on January 24, 2026, Version 1.0 established the foundational structural spine of the system: the **SeaGaP-MP** framework. Drawing from deep experience in medical imaging workflows, it was clear that research required a consistent procedural language to bridge the gap between diverse personas. Without a standard lifecycle, system goals remain ill-defined and idiosyncratic, making it impossible to coordinate complex multi-site operations.

The resolution was a five-stage linear pipeline—Search, Gather, Process, Monitor, and Post—that imposed a strict temporal order on research operations. This version also introduced the "Tactical Header" and role-based login, proving that a unified interface could manage the complexities of federated data discovery. The SeaGaP framework ensured that progress was no longer a matter of opinion, but a sequence of logical transitions that could be visually tracked and verified.
_See also: link:philosophy.adoc[ARGUS Philosophy] for the full SeaGaP-MP conceptual framework._

=== Version 1.1: State-Aware Navigation
The v1.1 update addressed the "Statelessness Problem" identified immediately after the initial baseline. While v1.0 displayed the workflow tracker, it was merely a visual ornament; clicking its stations did nothing, and it had no knowledge of whether a user was searching or gathering. This lack of state awareness made the system feel like a collection of static pages rather than a coherent application, creating a significant barrier to effective operation.

To resolve this, v1.1 refactored the tracker to drive stage transitions, marking the first move toward a state-aware UI. This release introduced the concept of "visited" and "active" states for workflow stations, ensuring that the user's progress was visually synchronized with the application's internal state machine. It proved that the UI could be used as a mirror of the underlying logical state, a principle that would later be hardened into the "State-First" mandate of v10.0.

=== Version 1.3: The RPN Mandate and Layout Integrity
Version 1.3 was a critical "Architectural Pause" necessitated by the rapid increase in code complexity during the solo sprint. Traditional imperative naming conventions (e.g., `expandWorkspace`) were obscuring the primary targets of functions, leading to "spaghetti-logic" where it was difficult to locate relevant code. Furthermore, layout regressions in the top panel were causing text to truncate on modern FHD laptop displays, undermining the project's professional aesthetic.

The resolution was the mandatory implementation of **RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)** naming (`subject_verb`). This shifted the focus of the codebase toward objects and their actions (e.g., `workspace_expand`), making the system infinitely more navigable. This release also fixed the top-panel overflows and implemented the first formal "Logout" protocol, ensuring that session state could be cleared reliably before a new research persona took control of the console.
_See also: link:framework.adoc[Framework Patterns] for the RPN naming specification._

=== Version 1.4: Multi-Window Telemetry and the Subway Layout
The final release of Phase I, v1.4, introduced the "Hanging Subway" layout—a specialized LCARS geometry designed to maximize screen real estate for telemetry. From a systems perspective, it was evident that monitoring a federated network through a single log window is insufficient; simultaneous visibility into loss curves, node status, and participant metadata is required to detect anomalies in real-time.

This version implemented multi-window rendering for the **Monitor** stage, allowing these diverse data streams to be displayed in parallel using a "provider-renderer" pattern. It also included the first automated test harness for data models, establishing the "Zero-DOM Policy" by proving that the system's core logic could be verified independently of the browser's document model. This release transformed ARGUS from a simple viewer into a professional scientific dashboard.

== Phase II: The Intelligence Console and the "Agentic Pivot" (v1.4.1 - v3.4)
_Period: January 26 – January 28, 2026_

=== Version 1.4.1 - 1.4.3: Terminal Hardening
These rapid-fire versions addressed the "Interaction Gap" identified after the launch of the Monitor stage. While the GUI was functional, it was too slow for technical directory manipulations. v1.4.1 through v1.4.3 focused on anchoring the top panel elements and expanding the terminal with common Linux filesystem commands (`ls`, `cat`, `mkdir`). This was the beginning of the shift toward a CLI-first developer experience.

The pressure driving these releases was the need for high-fidelity file inspection. Without a robust terminal, the content of the simulated project tree could not be verified. By integrating these builtins, ARGUS moved closer to becoming a true "Virtual Computer System," providing the tools necessary for researchers to inspect their data artifacts directly within the LCARS interface.

=== Version 1.4.4 - 1.4.5: The "MU/TH/UR" Streaming Refinement
Version 1.4.4 and 1.4.5 refined the terminal's visual experience, introducing the "MU/TH/UR" streaming style. Named after the computer in the *Alien* franchise, this protocol defined a utilitarian, non-human AI personality that communicated through character-by-character blue text. This was a deliberate design choice to move away from "friendly chatbots" toward an observational AI that felt like an integral part of the ship's computer.

The refinement of the streaming logic was driven by the need for better visual feedback during long-running operations. By using the `Typewriter` animation, ARGUS provided a sense of "system thought," reducing the perceived latency of AI queries. These versions established the "Observational Personality" that would eventually be formalized in the v10.0 Calypso Host.

=== Version 2.0.0: The Agentic Pivot and Intelligence Console
Released on January 26, 2026, v2.0.0 was the most significant conceptual shift in the project's history. It launched the **Unified Intelligence Console**, a retractable terminal that became the system's primary interaction surface. This was not a cosmetic update; it was a fundamental "Pivot to Agency." The goal was to allow the operator to drive the entire system through natural language, rather than searching through nested menus.

By repositioning the AI assistant, Calypso, as the central mediator of the scientific process, v2.0.0 transformed ARGUS into an agentic system. However, this pivot immediately exposed the "Irreducible Hallucination" problem: without a deterministic kernel to back it up, the AI would often claim success for actions it had no power to execute. This version established the **Interpretation-First Pipeline**, but the "Action" layer remained fuzzy and ungrounded.
_See also: link:calypso.adoc[CALYPSO Intelligence Host] for the kernel specification._

=== Version 3.0.0: The Reactive Update and Mock VFS
Version 3.0.0 addressed the "Context-Window Collapse" failure mode that plagued the early agentic pivot. Because the system's state was managed through disjointed variables, Calypso would frequently lose track of session progress. For instance, after a user renamed a project, the AI would continue to refer to the old name, causing confusion and procedural errors that compromised the integrity of the research.

The resolution was the migration to a **Pub/Sub (Observer) pattern** using a central `Store` and a global `EventBus`. This release also implemented the first "Mock VFS" and the IDE-style **Process** stage. By forcing every mutation to emit a typed event, the system ensured that all UI components (Terminal, Grid, Tracker) remained synchronized. This version established the "State-First" principle, proving that the UI must be a deterministic projection of an underlying state store.
_See also: link:framework.adoc[Framework Patterns] for the Pub/Sub and Store implementation details._

=== Version 3.1.0: Professionalized Marketplace and Frame Generation
This update focused on the scalability of the asset catalog. As the ATLAS ecosystem grew, it became clear that static HTML layouts were too rigid to accommodate the diverse range of pre-trained models and processing applications. The manual addition of new assets was becoming a bottleneck, preventing the rapid deployment of new scientific tools.

v3.1.0 introduced **Procedural Frame Generation**, allowing the LCARS UI to dynamically render high-density tiles and detail views based on JSON metadata. This release professionalized the marketplace, making it an extensible platform for MERIDIAN-compliant software. It proved that even the most complex LCARS geometries could be generated deterministically from data, further decoupling the system's "Appearance" from its "Logic."

=== Version 3.4.0: Visual Dialect Maturity and the Frame Slot
Version 3.4.0 introduced the **Frame Slot** system and **Beckon Pulse** visual language. These were engineered to solve the problem of "Interactive Overload," where users were overwhelmed by the number of clickable elements on the high-density console. The Beckon Pulse signaled interactivity through subtle brightness oscillations, reducing cognitive noise by removing the need for high-contrast "Click Me" buttons.

The Frame Slot system provided a standardized mechanism for animating panel transitions, ensuring that the UI felt like a cohesive "Living System" rather than a set of disjointed screens. This release ensured that the interface remained intuitive even as the system's technical capabilities ballooned, aligning the visual dialect with the rigorous requirements of clinical research environments where focus is paramount.

== Phase III: The VCS Substrate and the "Slot" Refactor (v4.0 - v4.7)
_Period: January 29 – February 1, 2026_

=== Version 4.0.0: The VCS Foundation
Released on January 29, 2026, v4.0.0 addressed the "Truth Gap" by introducing the **Virtual Computer System (VCS)**. It was recognized that for an AI agent to be truly safe, it must be embedded within a deterministic environment that behaves according to immutable rules. Legacy versions that managed state through JavaScript objects were inherently unverifiable and prone to silent corruption.

The VCS provided a simulated POSIX-compliant filesystem (**VFS**) and a process-aware **Shell**. This move shifted the system's "Ground Truth" from "Assertions in Memory" to "Artifacts on Disk." If the AI claimed to have harmonized a cohort, the system could now perform a physical check of the VFS for the `.harmonized` marker. If the file was absent, the AI's claim was rejected, creating the first hard safety gate against hallucination.
_See also: link:vcs.adoc[VCS Substrate], link:vfs.adoc[Virtual File System], and link:shell.adoc[VCS Shell] for exhaustive hardware-level specifications._

=== Version 4.5.0: The Multi-Mode Slot Architecture
Version 4.5.0 resolved a critical crisis of "DOM Pollution" in the overlay system. Multiple components (Marketplace, Project Detail, Dataset Detail) were competing for control of the same DOM containers. This led to "Cascading Failures" where closing one detail view would accidentally delete the buttons or state of the underlying Marketplace, requiring a full page refresh to recover.

The resolution was the **Slot Pattern**, which replaced destructive `innerHTML` mutation with a CSS-driven visibility model. By providing empty `overlay-slot` containers for each mode, the system ensured that visual states were isolated. This pattern enforced a strict "Host/Guest" relationship at the UI layer, proving that architectural isolation was the only way to maintain deterministic visual integrity in a complex multi-mode interface.
_See also: link:framework.adoc[Framework Patterns] for the Slot Pattern specification._

=== Version 4.7.0: MU/TH/UR Protocol and Idle Detection
The final release of Phase III, v4.7.0, implemented advanced idle detection and a persistent workspace. It was observed that complex analysis tasks often involve long periods of contemplation without console interaction. During these pauses, a reactive AI assistant remains dormant, missing critical opportunities to provide contextual guidance or status updates.

The "MU/TH/UR" protocol allowed Calypso to monitor activity and trigger proactive conversational thoughts (e.g., suggesting a project rename if a draft was unnamed). This version solidified the "Intelligence Host" metaphor, ensuring the AI was a participant in the workflow rather than a reactive chatbot. It prepared the system's core for the transition to headless, service-oriented execution.

== Phase IV: Headless Calypso, Scripts, and ORACLE (v5.0 - v8.0)
_Period: February 2 – February 13, 2026_

=== Version 5.0.0: The Headless Kernel and ORACLE v1.0
Released on February 3, 2026, v5.0.0 was a breakout milestone that bifurcated the "Calypso Core" from the browser runtime. It was clear that for ARGUS to be a professional research tool, it had to be verifiable in a headless server environment. Testing by manually clicking through a UI was slow, unscalable, and inherently non-deterministic, masking deep-seated logic bugs.

This separation enabled the development of the **ORACLE** methodology—a State-First Verification strategy. This version launched the Calypso CLI and the first in-process test runner, allowing the system to be verified in a CI/CD pipeline. By asserting on protocol codes and VFS artifacts instead of English text, v5.0.0 provided the first mathematical proof of system integrity, ensuring that "Truth" was measured in data, not words.
_See also: link:oracle.adoc[ORACLE Specification] for the reflexive verification methodology._

=== Version 5.1.6 - 5.1.9: CLI Hardening and Banner Normalization
These versions focused on the professionalization of the headless environment. Early versions of the CLI were difficult to read and lacked the "personality" of the LCARS interface. Furthermore, inconsistencies in username and home-path mapping between the browser and the terminal were causing VFS path-resolution errors that made testing unreliable.

v5.1.6 through v5.1.9 implemented robust dynamic padding for CLI banners and synchronized the headless server with the global Store singletons. This ensured that the researcher persona, project context, and version strings remained consistent across both graphical and terminal sessions. This era proved that "Lore" and "Logic" could be unified into a single systems specification.

=== Version 6.0.0: Persona-Driven Workflows and Manifests
Version 6.0.0 introduced **Persona-Driven Workflows**, addressing the "Persona Fragmentation" problem at the logic layer. It became evident that different researchers (e.g., Federated ML Developers vs. ChRIS Developers) required different stages, different commands, and different security permissions. Hardcoding a single SeaGaP sequence was no longer viable for a national-scale platform.

This release implemented the "Three-Tier Execution Model," where logic was categorized into Kernel (Core), Shell (Builtins), and Workflow (Manifests). It introduced the first YAML-based manifests to define these stages, providing the initial blueprint for the later Plugin refactor. v6.0.0 proved that the system's "operating model" could be swapped dynamically without changing the kernel code, making ARGUS a generic orchestrator for any scientific protocol.

=== Version 6.2.0: Data-State Alignment and NL Routing
Released on February 6, v6.2.0 completed the total migration of workflow progress to physical VFS markers (`.cohort`, `.harmonized`). Experience showed that as long as the system maintained any internal "completion flags," there was a risk of drift. The resolution was to eliminate all flags: progress was now determined solely by performing a topological walk of the disk.

This version also introduced the first iteration of the **Interpretation-First Pipeline**. By using deterministic regex matching to route common natural language verbs (e.g., "harmonize it") to system commands, the system reduced latency and prevented LLM misinterpretation. This phase established the "AI-as-a-Compiler" metaphor that would define the v10.0 architecture.

=== Version 7.0.0: Federation Orchestrator and Automation Scripts
Version 7.0.0 was a major release that introduced the first **Automation Scripts**. It was recognized that power users needed to execute complex, multi-step flows—such as site-local harmonization—through a single, repeatable command. The hardcoded "Simulate" button was replaced by a scriptable CLI layer, marking the first time domain logic was externalized from the core orchestrator.

This release also launched the **Federation Orchestrator** to manage the 4-phase "Federalization Handshake" (Briefing, Transcompile, Containerize, Dispatch). This service ensured that no model reached the network without formal human approval at every gate. v7.0.0 transformed federalization from a "black box" into a transparent, auditable process grounded in Merkle materialization and explicit security receipts.
_See also: link:federation.adoc[Federation Orchestrator] for the handshake protocol._
_See also: link:shell.adoc[VCS Shell] for the script execution specification._

=== Version 7.0.1 - 7.0.5: Narrative Expansion and Lore
These updates addressed the "Documentation Gap." It was found that understanding the deep engineering rationale behind concepts like the VCS and SeaGaP was critical for maintaining the codebase during the high-velocity sprint. Without context, the codebase felt like a collection of arbitrary choices.

v7.0.1 through v7.0.5 enriched the markdown storytelling and expanded the project's backstory (`story.md`). By weaving the engineering history into the "Scientific Lore" of the project, we ensured that the project's intent was preserved. This era established the "Historical Voice" standard that would later be formalized in the project's writing guide.

=== Version 7.1.0 - 7.1.10: Triad Clarification and Positioning
This sequence reframed ARGUS within the broader ARPA-H national federated learning initiative. The project's positioning was ambiguous; it was often confused with the underlying ATLAS platform itself. This lack of clarity was a barrier to clinical partnership and onboarding.

Versions 7.1.0 through 7.1.10 clarified the "Triad" relationship between ATLAS (The Network), Calypso (The Kernel), and ARGUS (The Interface). This era focused on "Developer Grounding," providing the reading order and setup documentation required for national-scale deployment. It transformed the project from a "mockup" into a "conceptual idea" for the national ATLAS user layer.

=== Version 7.2.0 - 7.2.1: WebSocket Service Decomposition
Version 7.2.0 refactored the core into a layered WebSocket architecture. This decomposition was driven by the requirement for remote research sessions. In a clinical environment, the researcher's interface (the browser) and the research data (the server) are often physically separated by secure hospital firewalls.

The WebSocket layer allowed the headless kernel to reside on a secure server while the LCARS interface ran in a local browser. This move finalized the "Service-Oriented" vision of the Calypso Host, ensuring that the system's integrity model was independent of the transport layer. It was the final prerequisite for the v10.0 "Plugin Revolution."

=== Version 7.3.0 - 7.3.1: Command Protocol Alignment
These releases aligned the Federation Orchestrator's internal command protocol with the workflow manifest stage commands. It was discovered that the orchestrator was still using "custom logic" to handle its phases, which bypassed the DAG Engine's standard verification gates. This was a source of subtle "State Drift" during federation handshakes.

v7.3.0 eliminated these custom paths, forcing all orchestrator commands through the standard manifest-driven pipeline. This made the federalization handshake as verifiable and auditable as any other SeaGaP stage. It was the final "Cleanup" before the move to the v9.0 DAG revolution.

== Phase V: The v10.x Plugin Revolution and Hardening Line (v9.0 - v10.3.1)
_Period: February 14 – February 20, 2026_

=== Version 9.0.0: Manifest-Driven DAG Engine
Released on February 16, 2026, the v9.0.x series replaced the legacy linear state machine with a **Manifest-Driven DAG Engine**. Scientific workflows are rarely linear; they involve complex branching, re-execution of upstream stages, and parallel parentage that linear models cannot represent. This "Graph-Gap" was a primary source of state-drift in legacy versions.

The DAG Engine resolved this by modeling processes as Directed Acyclic Graphs defined in external YAML manifests. It introduced the **Topological Position Resolution** algorithm, which determined the current stage by walking the VFS and checking for artifact evidence. This ensured that the system's "conscience" was always grounded in the physical disk, making it immune to the "Instructional Decay" that plagued earlier versions.
_See also: link:dag-engine.adoc[DAG Engine Specification] for the manifest schema and topological resolution logic._

=== Version 9.6.0: The Merkle Revolution
Version 9.6.0 introduced **Merkle Fingerprinting**, addressing the problem of "Silent Data Modification." While the VFS tracked the existence of files, it could not detect if an upstream file (e.g., the search query results) had been tampered with after a downstream stage (e.g., the gathered cohort) had been completed. This lack of cryptographic anchoring was a significant risk for clinical reproducibility.

The Merkle Engine solved this by cryptographically anchoring every artifact to its specific parentage using recursive SHA-256 hashes. If a researcher re-executed an early stage, the system would instantly flag all downstream stages as `[STALE]`, providing a mathematical guarantee against scientific inconsistency. This release transformed the filesystem into a "Proven Ledger," providing the absolute integrity required for regulated medical research.
_See also: link:merkle-engine.adoc[Merkle Engine Specification] for the recursive hashing math and staleness algorithms._

=== Version 10.0.0: The Plugin Runtime Revolution
The project reached its current v10.0 state on February 17, 2026. This was the final "Revolution"—the definitive separation of the **Host (Kernel)** from the **Guest (Logic)**. It was realized that as long as domain logic lived in the kernel, the system could never be truly generic, secure, or developer-friendly. Every new research persona required a deep refactor of the core `CalypsoCore` class.

The move to v10.0 purged all domain logic from the kernel and moved it to atomic **Guest Plugins**. The system is now a formal Host VM, providing a strictly-typed **PluginContext** (Standard Library) to unprivileged logic. This bifurcation ensures that the "Integrity" of the system is managed by the high-integrity Host, while the "Intelligence" remains a flexible AI interface. It resolves the "Irreducible Hallucination" problem by forcing all work into plugins and all progress into Merkle-proven artifacts, transforming ARGUS into a verifiable scientific operating system.
_See also: link:architecture.adoc[System Architecture] for the Host/Guest VM model specification._
_See also: link:plugins.adoc[Plugin System Specification] for the VM and context details._

=== Version 10.2.1 - 10.2.2: The Hardening Release Line
By February 20, 2026, it was clear that early v10.x represented a partial but incomplete pivot: plugin boundaries existed, but some federation behavior and simulation assumptions still leaked into backend pathways. The engineering pressure in this period was not feature expansion; it was architectural purification.

The v10.2.1 to v10.2.2 line hardens that boundary through a coordinated
deletion-and-rebinding pass.
Federation compute was fully materialized as explicit `federate-*` stage plugins,
which removed remaining backend orchestrator pathways and erased legacy
`federationState` coupling. In parallel, synthetic compute latency was deleted from
backend execution paths so runtime realism became strictly plugin-local behavior
that can be disabled deterministically with `CALYPSO_FAST=true` during oracle and CI
execution. The verification baseline was then restored against current store and
Merkle semantics, confirming that hardening did not trade boundary purity for test
instability.

This release line is intentionally framed as a hardening checkpoint rather than a
terminal destination. `v10.2.2` marks the stabilization baseline before `v10.3`
deletion work removes compatibility scaffolding and before `v11.0` enforces formal
contract lock across Host kernel, plugin compute, and adapter rendering boundaries.

=== Version 10.3.0: The Deletion Pass
After hardening, the next engineering step is subtraction. The objective is to remove
transitional runtime scaffolding so only one architecture path remains active.

The first v10.3 wave targeted three migration-era seams that preserved dual-path
behavior. Legacy materialization mode branching and join-toggle wiring were removed
so runtime materialization now follows one canonical store/join path. Calypso
configuration was reduced by deleting runtime materialization and join toggles from
`CalypsoCore`, preventing dual-mode boot semantics. SessionStore flat-root
compatibility (`rootStageInOwnDirectory`) and its companion compatibility tests were
also deleted so one deterministic stage-path contract remains.

This release completes the architectural cleanup phase between hardening and
contract lock by converting optional legacy behavior into enforced invariants.

=== Version 10.3.1: Contract Hardening Sweep and Stabilization Patch
The next hardening sweep focused on removing remaining backend-internalized behavior
that could reintroduce hidden workflow coupling before v11 contract lock.

The status quo at the start of this sweep was a partially purified kernel: major
federation orchestration had already moved into stage plugins, yet residual
internalizations still persisted in boundary layers. The catalyst was not a single
crash, but the recognition that pre-v11 contract lock could fail silently if command
vocabulary, handler ownership, and bootstrap identity remained encoded as backend
assumptions rather than runtime declarations.

The investigation centered on three pressure fronts. First, plugin loading still
carried migration-era traces of static backend ownership semantics. Second, routing
and intent compilation still permitted hidden command-policy drift whenever parser
vocabularies diverged from manifest command sets. Third, bootstrap literals
(`fedml`, `DRAFT`) preserved a legacy identity model incompatible with explicit,
portable runtime context.

The resolution was a coordinated deletion-and-rebinding pass. Plugin dispatch moved
fully to convention-based dynamic resolution with runtime export validation and
manifest-load-time handler resolvability checks. Workflow command ownership was
re-grounded in manifest declarations by removing stage-specific routing overrides and
binding intent acceptance to active-manifest command verbs. ScriptRuntime federation
translation branches were deleted and replaced with declarative command steps, so
automation semantics now remain script-visible rather than runtime-hidden. Bootstrap
identity resolution in core and store paths was converted from literal defaults to an
explicit chain spanning config, environment, active project state, persisted session
context, and workflow registry fallback.

The architectural outcome is a materially stricter Host/Guest boundary. Manifests now
define orchestration vocabulary and handler intent, plugins own compute semantics, and
backend runtime no longer carries latent persona pipelines or project-name surrogates
that can accumulate untracked debt.

Late in the cut process, an additional stabilization patch inside `10.3.1` repaired
session continuity across first-project activation and corrected oracle `${session}`
interpolation to bind to runtime session state. That patch closed a false-negative
verification seam and restored full oracle green status without reintroducing backend
simulation behavior.

== Conclusion: The Arc of Integrity

The evolution of ARGUS from January to February 2026 is a chronicle of the "Scientific Hardening" of AI. Each major version was a response to a specific failure mode where human trust in the system was compromised by AI-mediated ambiguity. From the early "Gutter Flash" regressions to the final "Merkle Staleness" proofs, the project has consistently prioritized "Evidence over Assertion."

By grounding the entire system in a virtualized hardware substrate (VCS), a graph-based conscience (DAG Engine), and a Merkle provenance chain, ARGUS `v10.3.1` now represents the stabilized hardening baseline at the end of the v10 deletion line. The project stands as a successful proof-of-concept for how agentic systems can be made structurally safe, transforming the "Hallucinating Agent" into a high-fidelity instrument of scientific discovery. The next arc is explicit: complete residual debt removal and lock Host/Guest contracts in `v11.0`.
