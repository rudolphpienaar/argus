= Calypso Service Architecture
:revnumber: 7.2.0
:revdate: 2026-02-16
:status: LEGACY

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Historical Grounding**: This document recorded the v7.2.0 refactor which decomposed the monolithic CLI and Server into a layered WebSocket service.

**Superseded by**: link:../calypso.adoc[CALYPSO: The AI Core] and link:../architecture.adoc[ARGUS Architecture] (v9.0.0)

**Reason for Supersession**: In v9.0.0, the orchestrator core was further decomposed into specialized Providers. While the protocol remains valid, the internal logic flow described here (as a monolithic 2000-line core) is no longer accurate.
