[IMPORTANT]
====
**Historical Grounding**: This document captured the "lessons learned" from the initial LCARS UI refactor (v0.2.0). It established the correct HTML/CSS structure for authentic LCARS components.

**Reason for Supersession**: The UI patterns are now mature and codified in `src/lcars-framework/`. While the HTML structure remains valid, the project's focus has shifted to agentic logic and DAG orchestration. Developer onboarding is now handled by `docs/onboarding.adoc`.
