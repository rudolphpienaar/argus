= Persona Workflows: Legacy Experience Definitions
:revnumber: 1.0.0
:revdate: 2026-02-16
:status: LEGACY

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Historical Grounding**: This document defined the initial transition from hardcoded stage logic to declarative YAML. It introduced the concept of data-state grounding and the "Three Layers of Defense" against LLM drift.

**Superseded by**: link:../dag-engine.adoc[DAG Engine Specification] (v9.0.0)

**Reason for Supersession**: The "Workflow" logic has been fully merged into the **DAG Engine**. The old schema (using `intents` and `validation.condition` JS strings) was replaced by the more robust `handler` and `completes_with` model.
