[IMPORTANT]
====
**Historical Grounding**: This document established the "Switchboard" pattern, decoupling natural language intents from deterministic commands.

**Superseded by**: link:../dag-engine.adoc[DAG Engine Specification] (Manifest Handler Registry)

**Reason for Supersession**: Manual switchboard mapping is now handled dynamically via the `handler` field in manifest YAMLs and the `HANDLER_REGISTRY` in `CalypsoCore.ts`.
