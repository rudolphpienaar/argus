# Framework Formalization Plan (v4.5.1)
**Status: LEGACY / HISTORICAL RECORD**

> **Historical Grounding**: This document captured the checkpoint for the v4.5.1 framework extraction. It recorded the state of the Pub/Sub system and the initial overlay guard patterns.
>
> **Reason for Supersession**: Superseded by the live `docs/framework.adoc` and the comprehensive v9.0.0 refactor. This file remains only as a point-in-time architectural audit.
