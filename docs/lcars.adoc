= ARGUS LCARS Interface Design
:toc:
:icons: font

This document captures the specific interaction and visual metaphors used in the ARGUS (ATLAS Resource Graphical User System) LCARS interface.

== The Intelligence Console (Terminal)

The terminal is the primary command buffer for ARGUS. It functions as a "Unified Intelligence Console" where both standard system commands (bash-like) and natural language queries (LCARSLM) are processed.

=== Visual Metaphor: The Tactical Drawer

The terminal is conceptually positioned **between** the Status Header (top panel) and the Operational Workspace (bottom panel). It is designed as a "retractable drawer" that unfurls from behind the main workspace.

.Key Design Principles:
* **Frameless Integration**: To avoid visual clutter, the terminal does not have its own left-side LCARS framing. Instead, it sits flush against the primary `left-frame` (sidebar), which acts as a "rail" for the drawer.
* **The Workspace Lid**: The horizontal `bar-panel` (containing bars 6-10) functions as the physical "lid" of the bottom panel.
* **Retraction Logic**:
  - **Closed**: The lid sits at the top of the right-frame; the terminal is hidden.
  - **Open**: The lid slides downward, revealing the terminal screen above it.
* **Dynamic Elbows**: The LCARS corner elbows are attached to the sliding "lid" rather than the frame, ensuring a flush join at any deployment height.

=== Interaction Metaphor: The Pullable Access Strip

The primary method for adjusting the terminal's height is the **Access Strip**.

* **The Handle**: A horizontal bar sitting precisely on the workspace lid.
* **Draggable Workspace**: By "grabbing" this handle, the user physically pulls the entire workspace down, increasing the terminal's visibility.
* **Visual Feedback**: The handle changes color from `october-sunset` to `canary` and glows when active, providing tactile confirmation.
* **Integrated Toggles**:
  - **Tactical Close**: A glowing `mars` red pill at the top-right of the terminal header for quick retraction.
  - **Primary Toggle**: The leftmost orange bar (`bar-6`) of the workstation lid acts as a large-target toggle switch.

== Typography: The Dual-Voice System

ARGUS uses the **Antonio** font family with a selective casing strategy to balance LCARS fidelity with developer utility:

* **The System Voice (Uppercase)**: All structural elements, headers, prompts, and button labels are strictly uppercase. This defines the "Ship's Computer" authoritative presence.
* **The Data Voice (Mixed Case)**: Terminal output (AI responses, file contents) and user input allow mixed case. This preserves technical accuracy (e.g., `train.py`) and improves readability for long AI explanations.
* **Visual Polish**: Terminal readouts feature a soft text-shadow glow, simulating a high-density CRT display.

== Color Language

ARGUS adheres to a strict LCARS color palette defined in `lcars.css`:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Variable | Functional Meaning | Context

| `--honey`
| Primary Structural
| Header bars, elbows, primary navigation.

| `--october-sunset`
| Alert / Active
| Current stage indicator, active system processes.

| `--nebula`
| Intelligence / AI
| LCARSLM status, neural link indicators.

| `--galaxy`
| Utility / Simulation
| Secondary console functions, simulation mode.

| `--mars`
| Critical / Warning / Tactical
| Reset functions, error states, and the terminal "Retract" control.

== Implementation Details

* **Global Component**: The `LCARSTerminal` is a global singleton initialized in `app_initialize()`.
* **State Managed**: Visibility and height are controlled via CSS classes (`.open`) and inline style overrides.
* **Contextual Intelligence**: 
  - **Prompts**: Updates based on SeaGaP stage (`ARGUS: SEARCH >`, `ARGUS: COHORT >`, `dev@argus:~/ $`).
  - **Status Readout**: The terminal header displays the active AI provider and model ID (e.g., `MODE: [GEMINI] // MODEL: [GEMINI-FLASH-LATEST]`).
