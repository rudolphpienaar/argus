= ARGUS LCARS Interface Design

This document captures the specific interaction and visual metaphors used in the ARGUS (ATLAS Resource Graphical User System) LCARS interface.

== The Intelligence Console (Terminal)

The terminal is the primary command and control hub for ARGUS. It functions as a "Unified Intelligence Console" where standard system commands (bash-like), natural language queries (LCARSLM), and agentic UI manipulations are integrated into a single stream.

=== Visual Metaphor: The Tactical Drawer

The terminal is conceptually positioned **between** the Status Header (top panel) and the Operational Workspace (bottom panel). It is designed as a "retractable drawer" that unfurls from behind the main workspace.

.Key Design Principles:
* **Frameless Integration**: To avoid visual clutter, the terminal does not have its own left-side LCARS framing. Instead, it sits flush against the primary `left-frame` (sidebar), which acts as a "rail" for the drawer.
* **The Workspace Lid**: The horizontal `bar-panel` (containing bars 6-10) functions as the physical "lid" of the bottom panel.
* **Retraction Logic**:
  - **Closed**: The lid sits at the top of the right-frame; the terminal is hidden.
  - **Open**: The lid slides downward, revealing the terminal screen above it.
* **Dynamic Elbows**: The LCARS corner elbows are attached to the sliding "lid" rather than the frame, ensuring a flush join at any deployment height.

=== Interaction Metaphor: The Pullable Access Strip

The primary method for adjusting the terminal's height is the **Access Strip**.

* **The Handle**: A horizontal bar sitting precisely on the workspace lid.
* **Draggable Workspace**: By "grabbing" this handle, the user physically pulls the entire workspace down, increasing the terminal's visibility.
* **Visual Feedback**: The handle changes color from `october-sunset` to `canary` and glows when active, providing tactile confirmation.
* **Integrated Toggles**:
  - **Tactical Close**: A glowing `mars` red pill at the top-right of the terminal header for quick retraction.
  - **Primary Toggle**: The leftmost orange bar (`bar-6`) of the workstation lid acts as a large-target toggle switch.

== Operational Modes

The terminal dynamically adapts its persona and capabilities based on the active SeaGaP stage.

=== Search Mode (AI Core)
During the Search stage, the terminal acts as an AI-driven discovery engine.
* **Prompt**: `ARGUS: SEARCH >`
* **Agentic Logic**: The AI can automatically select datasets in the visual grid using the `[SELECT: ID]` intent parser.
* **Telematic Readout**: The visual grid below the terminal serves as a secondary evidence display, updating in real-time as the AI identifies relevant cohorts.

=== Developer Mode (Technical Shell)
Upon entering the Process stage, the console transitions into a technical coding environment.
* **Prompt**: `dev@argus:~/src/project $`
* **Styling**: The UI automatically switches to a monospaced font (**Inconsolata**), clears history, and enables mixed-case input/output for technical accuracy.
* **Commands**: Supports standard linux-style commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `python`).

== Typography: The Dual-Voice System

ARGUS uses the **Antonio** font family with a selective casing strategy:

* **The System Voice (Uppercase)**: All structural elements, headers, prompts, and button labels are strictly uppercase.
* **The Data Voice (Mixed Case)**: Terminal output (AI responses, file contents) and user input allow mixed case to preserve technical precision and improve readability.
* **Visual Polish**: Terminal readouts feature a soft text-shadow glow, simulating a high-density CRT display.

== Implementation Details

* **Global Component**: The `LCARSTerminal` is a global singleton.
* **Intent Parsing**: The `terminal_handleCommand` function intercepts LLM responses to trigger system actions (selecting data, transitioning stages).
* **Contextual Awareness**: The AI engine receives the full dataset catalog and the user's current "Selection Buffer" with every query, ensuring high-fidelity RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) reasoning.
