== Abstract

The design philosophy of ARGUS is centered on the principle of **Data-State Grounding**—the architectural mandate that the authoritative state of a scientific workflow must be a verifiable property of the filesystem. This document outlines the conceptual framework of ARGUS, detailing the SeaGaP-MP workflow model and the engineering rationale for grounding AI-mediated interactions in physical, Merkle-proven artifacts.

== Introduction: The Historical Context

The development of ARGUS emerged from the unique challenge of building national-scale infrastructure for federated learning in healthcare. Early attempts at agentic interfaces in this domain often suffered from a lack of "environmental grounding." In these legacy systems, AI assistants would frequently lose track of complex, multi-stage processes because the workflow state was maintained only in ephemeral memory or transient database rows. This led to "contextual drift," where the AI would confidently recommend next steps based on incorrect premises about what work had actually been completed.

We learned that for high-stakes medical research, "Truth" cannot be an assertion; it must be evidence. The resolution was the adoption of the **SeaGaP-MP** framework (Search, Gather, Process, Monitor, Post) combined with a data-state-centric compute model inherited from the ChRIS platform. In ARGUS, progress is not tracked by internal counters, but by the physical materialization of artifacts within a Virtual File System (VFS). This philosophy ensures that the system's logic is always anchored to the physical reality of the project tree.

== The SeaGaP-MP Workflow Framework: The Structural Spine

To manage the inherent complexity of federated medical imaging, ARGUS enforces a unifying interaction pattern called SeaGaP-MP. This framework provides a consistent "spine" across all user personas, from researchers to clinicians.

1.  **Search:** The exploratory phase where users query the ATLAS catalog to discover relevant datasets.
2.  **Gather:** The assembly phase where selected resources are mounted into a virtual workspace and cost estimates are generated.
3.  **Process:** The execution phase where domain-specific work—such as code development, annotation, or inference—is performed.
4.  **Monitor:** The observation phase where users track real-time telemetry from distributed sites.
5.  **Post:** The finalization phase where results are validated and published back to the community.

By standardizing on this sequence, ARGUS makes diverse research tasks tractable and ensures that the provenance of every scientific result is captured through a predictable chain of custody.

== User Personas: Diverse Goals, Unified Pattern

While the SeaGaP-MP sequence is universal, the content of each stage is adapted to specific personas.

*   **Federated ML Developer:** Focuses on high-fidelity coding environments and the transformation of local training loops into federated "Phantom" simulations.
*   **Annotator:** Prioritizes ergonomic image navigation and the consistent application of clinical labels.
*   **Administrator:** Requires visibility into platform governance, audit logs, and resource allocation.

The architecture ensures that despite these varying needs, the underlying state transformations remain consistent. Every persona's progress is grounded in the same VFS-based materialization pipeline, making the system universally verifiable.

== Data-State Computation: The ChRIS Lineage

ARGUS is the interface to a platform whose compute model is fundamentally data-state-centric. This model, inherited from the ChRIS platform, represents computation as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each node is a mortal container that consumes `/input` and produces `/output`.

In ARGUS, we extend this principle to the UI layer. The system reasons about workflow progress by inspecting the physical state of the VFS—checking for the existence of `.harmonized` markers, `train.py` scaffolds, and `.federated` receipts. This eliminates the "whack-a-mole" bug cycle associated with in-memory state tracking and provides the LLM with a "Ground Truth" context derived directly from the filesystem.

== Conclusion

The ARGUS philosophy ensures that the system remains a "Guardian of Process." By grounding all interactions in a standardized workflow and a persistent filesystem substrate, we create a bridge between human intent and federated complexity that is both intuitive and scientifically rigorous. The move to v10.0 completes this vision, providing an environment where every claim made by the AI is backed by a cryptographically anchored artifact.
