= ATLAS Marketplace Specification (v3.1.0)
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== 1. Overview
The ATLAS Marketplace is a global asset registry providing ChRIS plugins (MERIDIAN apps), reference datasets, and pre-trained models. It serves as the primary distribution channel for extending the capabilities of an ARGUS instance.

== 2. Asset Types

|===
| Type | Description | VFS Impact

| `plugin`
| Containerized MERIDIAN/ChRIS applications.
| Symlinked to `/home/developer/bin/` upon installation.

| `dataset`
| Standalone reference cohorts for local validation.
| Mounted to `/home/developer/projects/reference/`.

| `model`
| Pre-trained neural network weights (e.g. ResNet, UNet).
| Downloaded to `/home/developer/models/`.

== 3. Installation Lifecycle

The Marketplace is a **Public Service** (accessible without authentication) but requires an active session for VFS integration.

1.  **Browse:** Users explore the high-density grid.
2.  **Install:** Clicking "INSTALL" triggers a background payload download.
3.  **VFS Mount:** The `Store` dispatches an `ASSET_INSTALLED` event. The `VirtualFileSystem` creates the necessary file handles.
4.  **Terminal Notification:** The Intelligence Console confirms availability and provides usage hints.

== 4. Architectural Integration
The Marketplace is decoupled from the SeaGaP workflow. It operates as a modal overlay driven by the central `Store` and `EventBus`, ensuring that assets installed while in the "Process" stage are immediately visible in the IDE asset tree.
