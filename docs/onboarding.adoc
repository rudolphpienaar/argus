== Welcome to ARGUS

ARGUS (ATLAS Resource Guided User System) is the UI layer for the ATLAS federated medical imaging platform. It is a **Vanilla TypeScript** application that implements the SeaGaP-MP workflow (Search, Gather, Process, Monitor, Post).

**The Golden Rule:** There is no framework (React, Vue, Svelte). We use raw DOM manipulation, orchestrated by a custom Pub/Sub Store and strict architectural patterns.

== The Mental Model

To work on ARGUS, you need to understand three core concepts:

=== The Store is Truth

Everything that changes (current stage, selected datasets, training status) lives in `src/core/state/store.ts`.

*   **Don't** mutate state directly.
*   **Do** call Store actions (e.g., `store.dataset_select(id)`).
*   **Do** listen for events (e.g., `events.on(Events.STATE_CHANGED, ...)`).

=== The Virtual Computer (VCS)

ARGUS isn't just a website; it simulates a computer.

*   It has a filesystem (`src/vfs/`).
*   It has a shell (`src/vfs/Shell.ts`) with environment variables (`$HOME`, `$PWD`).
*   It has a terminal.

**Key Concept:** "Providers" bridge the gap. When you select a dataset in the UI, the `DatasetProvider` effectively "mounts" that data into the virtual filesystem at `~/data/cohort/`.

=== The Stage Lifecycle

The app moves through stages (Search -> Gather -> Process -> Monitor -> Post).

*   **Entry Point:** `src/argus.ts` is the orchestrator.
*   **Lifecycle:** Each stage module (e.g., `src/core/stages/process.ts`) exports `stage_enter()` and `stage_exit()` hooks.
*   **Control Flow:** The orchestrator calls `currentStage.stage_exit()` -> `nextStage.stage_enter()`.

=== SeaGaP Boundary Model (Search vs Gather)

Keep these boundaries strict when implementing features:

*   **Search (Discovery):** Query/filter catalog data and publish discovery results.
*   **Gather (Assembly):** Select datasets, mount cohort inputs, and manage gather workspace/detail flows.
*   **Rule of thumb:** Search finds candidates; Gather commits cohort intent.

If a change touches project/dataset detail overlays, gather workspace transitions, or cohort selection state, it is Gather work even if initiated from a Search-stage click.

== Codebase Tour

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Path | What's Inside

| `src/argus.ts`
| **The Orchestrator.** Initializes the app, sets up the VCS, and handles high-level events. Keep this file clean.

| `src/lcars-framework/`
| **The UI Library.** Reusable LCARS components (Terminal, WorkflowTracker) that know *nothing* about ARGUS business logic.

| `src/core/state/`
| **The Brain.** `store.ts` (state) and `events.ts` (pub/sub bus).

| `src/core/logic/`
| **The Logic Layer.** Specialized services like `commands.ts` (routing), `WindowBindings.ts` (DOM glue), and `Lifecycle.ts`.

| `src/core/syntax/`
| **Language Registry.** Canonical syntax-language detection/mapping shared by browser and TUI highlighting.

| `src/core/stages/`
| **The Scenes.** Stage entry modules (`search.ts`, `gather.ts`, `process.ts`, ...) plus stage-scoped subdirectories for controllers/actions/ui/runtime.

| `src/vfs/`
| **The Computer.** The virtual filesystem, shell, and content generators.

| `src/lcarslm/`
| **The AI.** Service for communicating with Gemini/OpenAI (RAG logic).

== Rules of the Road

=== Naming: RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)

We use `object_method` naming to group related functionality.

*   ✅ `project_load()`, `dataset_select()`, `terminal_toggle()`
*   ❌ `loadProject()`, `selectDataset()`, `toggleTerminal()`

=== The Slot Pattern

We avoid rewriting `innerHTML` for complex overlays.

*   The `#asset-detail-overlay` has empty "slots" (`#overlay-content-slot`).
*   When you open a Project Detail, you simply **show** the slot and **render** into it.
*   When you close it, you **clear** the slot.
*   *Never* touch the original Marketplace DOM that shares the overlay.

=== Window Bindings

HTML `onclick="myFunc()"` requires `myFunc` to be on `window`.

*   **Don't** just say `(window as any).myFunc = ...`
*   **Do** register it in `src/core/logic/WindowBindings.ts`.

=== Plugin/Stage Boundary

Plugins must remain surface-agnostic.

*   **Do:** Return typed `PluginResult` payloads (`statusCode`, `message`, `actions`, `artifactData`).
*   **Do:** Keep browser/TUI-specific rendering in stage/controller/view modules.
*   **Don't:** Import `src/core/stages/*` or `src/core/logic/*` from `src/plugins/*`.
*   **Enforcement:** Run `npm run check:boundaries` before merge.

See `docs/plugins.adoc` for the runtime contract and `docs/architecture.adoc` for ownership rationale.

=== Shell/Rendering Boundary

Keep this responsibility split explicit:

*   **Shell owns execution** (`src/vfs/Shell.ts`): command semantics, stdout/stderr, exit codes.
*   **Registry owns language mapping** (`src/core/syntax/languageRegistry.ts`): file/`cat` detection and alias normalization.
*   **WUI owns HTML rendering** (`src/core/logic/commands.ts`, `src/ui/syntaxHighlight.ts`).
*   **TUI owns ANSI rendering** (`src/calypso/ui/tui/TuiRenderer.ts`, `src/calypso/ui/tui/SyntaxHighlight.ts`).

Do not add independent extension/language maps in renderer modules. Add mappings once in the registry and reuse everywhere.

== "Hello World": Adding a Command

Want to add a new command called `hello` to the terminal?

1.  **Edit `src/core/logic/commands.ts`**:
    Route commands through `CalypsoCore.command_execute(...)` (already wired by default).
    New deterministic workflow behavior should be added in `src/lcarslm/CalypsoCore.ts`.

[source,typescript]
----
// CalypsoCore.ts
if (primaryCommand === 'hello') {
    return {
        success: true,
        message: 'Hello, World!',
        actions: []
    };
}
----

The terminal router delegates to CalypsoCore first, then falls back to the LLM when no first-class intent matches.

== "Hello World": Adding a Stage

1.  **Create `src/core/stages/mystage.ts`**:
    Implement `stage_enter()` and `stage_exit()`.

2.  **Register in `src/argus.ts`**:
    Import it and add it to `STAGE_HANDLERS`.

3.  **Update Navigation**:
    Add it to `STAGE_ORDER` in `src/core/logic/navigation.ts`.
