== Abstract

This document specifies the developer-experience contract used by ARGUS after the
v10 hardening line. The contract resolves a long-standing tension in scientific
software between mutable engineering workspaces and immutable provenance
requirements. Conventional platforms usually force a binary choice: either strict,
platform-managed pipelines with limited intervention, or unconstrained shell work
with weak lineage guarantees. ARGUS rejects that tradeoff and encodes both demands
inside one filesystem-native model.

The result is a two-zone operating structure in which active development remains
fast and local while every computational milestone remains materially preserved as a
Merkle-addressable lineage under session `provenance/` trees. This specification
explains why that model was necessary, how viewport rebinding keeps shell ergonomics
high without violating lineage truth, and how the resulting directory graph
functions as executable proof rather than passive storage.

== Introduction: Historical Context and Pressure

Earlier iterations of the stack treated developer convenience and scientific
integrity as neighboring concerns rather than a single design problem. During
high-velocity workflow execution this separation failed in predictable ways. Manual
edits to generated artifacts improved practical progress but blurred lineage,
because ad hoc edits could overwrite machine outputs in place. At the same time,
fully locking generated paths prevented real-world adaptation and pushed developers
outside the platform, where provenance disappeared entirely.

The hardening-era objective was therefore not interface polish but structural
unification. The filesystem itself had to become the shared language between human
intervention and machine execution. Once that requirement was accepted, the project
model converged on a simple but strict doctrine: mutable work occurs in a workshop
zone, immutable history accumulates in a vault zone, and transitions between the
two are mediated by deterministic copy-on-write semantics.

== The Two-Zone Filesystem Contract

ARGUS projects encode this contract directly in path layout.

----

The viewport links and project work directories provide the mutable room where
developers inspect artifacts, iterate on implementations, and run local tooling
without ceremony. The `provenance/` tree is the immutable room in which each
directory boundary records a causal execution step with its own control metadata
and payload artifacts. This partition is not metaphorical decoration. It is the
core mechanism that lets ARGUS behave like both an engineering workstation and a
scientific instrument.

== Viewport Rebinding Through Stage Portals

Each stage viewport link (for example, `search@` or `gather@`) is the operational
boundary object between mutable command interaction and immutable lineage state. The
shell beams the operator into the active stage portal at transition time, but does
not trap subsequent navigation. This preserves command-line autonomy while
maintaining a deterministic reference path back to active lineage context via `cd @`.

This mechanism preserves two properties that were historically in conflict. Human
intervention remains immediate and tool-compatible because normal shell traversal
and edits remain available. Provenance integrity remains intact because stage
completion and lineage continuity are evaluated from materialized artifacts, not from
working-directory assumptions.

== Path-as-Proof Semantics

In ARGUS, lineage is encoded in physical path structure rather than external
database joins. A path such as
`provenance/search/gather/harmonize/` states directly that `harmonize` consumed
artifacts produced by `gather`, which in turn consumed artifacts from `search`.
Branch evidence is encoded upstream through optional stage artifacts such as
`provenance/search/gather/ml-readiness/` and
`provenance/search/gather/collect/` before convergence into harmonization ingress.
The path graph is therefore not only storage topology; it is the executable causal
record.

This model removes a significant class of synchronization failures where metadata
claims diverge from payload reality. Because control envelopes and data artifacts
co-reside at each node, any project archive contains code, outputs, and the proof
structure that explains how those outputs came to exist.

== Architectural Outcome

The developer experience contract now aligns directly with the v10 hardening
mission. Mutable workflows remain practical for daily engineering, while scientific
history remains cryptographically and structurally inspectable without hidden
side-channels. The legacy session-tree distinction is no longer needed as a
separate conceptual store; operational memory is reconstructed from the active
project graph itself.

This outcome closes a core integrity gap before v11 contract lock. ARGUS no longer
asks operators to choose between speed and proof. It encodes both as native
filesystem behavior under one deterministic runtime model.
